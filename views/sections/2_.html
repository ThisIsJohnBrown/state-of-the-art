    <p>Mental lego pieces</p>
    <p>tinkering and trying things can help later in unexpected ways.</p>
    <p>Fail quickly</p>

        Failure
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>Appologize to Tracy in an awkward way</p>
    <p>but we kept going</p>
    <p>List failures - glue is not gluey enough, microcontrollers are too slow, fast microcontroller didn't work the same (grounding issue)</p>
    <p>some kind of analogy about failing to succeed</p>

    <h2>
        Success!
    </h2>
    <br>
    
    <p>Got the bugs ironed out!</p>
    <p>[maybe show video of flicking a pin]</p>

        Modular rendering system
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>100% JS</p>
    <p>started out as a single canvas -> projection mapping</p>
    <p>each "vis mode" renders to an off-screen canvas, board layout, and display canvas are abstracted from the visualizers</p>

        Image capture/GIF encoding
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>Tried a lot of things</p>
    <p>Capturing every frame - too slow!</p>
    <p>WebWorkers didn't make much of a difference</p>
    <p>Ended up capturing at a low framerate, then sending image data up one by one with progress bar</p>
    <p>server runs on node.js</p>
    <p>Express and socket.io handle communication to the front end, and serial peg data from the board</p>
    <p>GIF encoding is done in a child process (process.fork)</p>
