<!-- 
- Didn't start with any technology decisions (except javascript, duh)
- It's helpful to have someone to bounce ideas off of
- We sat in an empty studio and drew stuff on empty ikea boxes
- The idea we settled on was a mashup of previously unused project ideas
- It was plinko, plinco, plin.co

        Every plinco starts with a single peg

<!--
- Expanded prototype to 3 sensors, added projection, expanded it to the full board.
- Show assembly meadly 
- So excited!! Wired up all 85 pegs with 3000 lb epoxy.

<!--
- Do apology gag

- What went wrong?
- Lots. 3000 lb epoxy began spontaneously de-laminating creating dead pegs, arduino wasn't fast enough to scan the 85 peg array, faster Teensy had some electrical weirdness that was tricky to sort out.
- We missed our deadline, but we kept working on it
- [optional] Analogy

        Success!

    <p>[maybe show video of flicking a pin]</p>
<!--
- Had to completely dismantle and re-build all the pegs
- After many evenings of tinkering on the project, we got it working!
- [video of it working]
- Got to share it with creative coding groups, and even presented it at the Intel UX Summit at the Jupiter Hotel (where Cascadia JS was, just a few (hundred) days too late..)

        Reward
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>[something, image or video]</p>
<!--
- This kind of project is fun from a technical perspective, but that's only one reason we kept at it.
- Sharing it with others is even more rewarding than finishing the project to begin with.
- After buliding the kiosk, we can set it up and watch how people react to it.
- Making things like this is very different from building web apps, you have the chance to see the direct impact it has vs analytics.
- Because the reach is much smaller than the web, the reward is much more personal.

    <h2>Where's the JS?</h2>
    <br>
    <p class="fragment">Basically, everywhere.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Visualization in Chrome</p>
    <p class="fragment">Node.js for (almost) everything else</p>
<!--
- Hey Ben, that looks like a lot of hardware, this is an Empire JAY ESSSSS!
- You might not guess, but 99.99912873% of plin.co runs on JS in one way or another.
- The only non-JS portion is thet physical sensor hardware and a little microcontroller hooked up via USB.
- Lots of node.js happening, all the graphics, animation, and projector tricks are running in chrome.
