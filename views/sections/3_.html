        Projection Mapping

    <p>Brief description</p>
    <p>some images, minecraft block?</p>
    <p>how it works (very briefly)</p>
<!--
- What the hell is projection mapping?
- Like the "keystone" thing in your projector, but on steroids.
- Corrects perspective distortion.
- This is something I've used many times for other projects and experiments.
- If you imagine the projector lens as a camera lens, you'd see wierd distorted versions of the flat surfaces.
- By pre-distorting the content to match the same exact distorted view that the projector lens "sees" it cancels out.
- Content appears un-distorted.

    <br>
    <p>Came out of plin.co</p>
    <p>Built to emulate non-browser based mapping tools</p>
    <p>Useful! Feature packed!</p>
    <p>This often happens when you do projects, fun side-benefit.</p>
<!-- 
- Any time projected content needs to be set up quickly, projection mapping is super helpful.
- plin.co is a perfect case for this technique, Ben has been using commercial software for this stuff, how can we do it in the browser?
- 3D CSS is able to add 3D perspective to anything in the DOM!
- By using some cool tricks made possible by math (and numeric.js) we can compute a trasformation matrix based on arbitrary sets of corner points.

    <h2>
        Demo time!
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>Turn projector on with NODE! <input type="button" value="Turn it ON!" id="projector-on-button">
        <input type="button" value="Turn it off..." id="projector-off-button"></p>
    <p>Demo it. Use 2nd projector on stage and hold up foam core.</p>
<!--
- You want to see a demo?
- John, do you think this is going to work??
- First of all, we need to turn on this projector.
- It just so happens that most projectors can be remotely controlled over an old-school serial connection.
- It also just so happens that there node.js libraries for basically anything you can imagine.
- We've got a USB to Serial adapter here, connected to the projetor, controlled by node, and accessible via this button.
- Click.
- OK!
- So check it out, I can drag these corners around, and once I get them lined up, it looks all rad.
- End demo, turn off projector.

    <h2>
        Give it a try!
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>Free to use! We just made it because we needed it.</p>
    <p>Link to repo.</p>
<!--
- Initially this projection mapping code was built directyly into the plin.co rendering system.
- It seemed incredibly useful for other projects, seemed like a good idea to make it more general purpose.
- Now it is! maptastic.js, add projection mapping to your web project with 1 line of code.
- Projection mapping is a great way to get your work out into the real world in a visually stunning way, you don't need fancy hardware, any projector will work. I suggest that you go crazy.
- Side projcets like plin.co often yeild helpful tools like this.
